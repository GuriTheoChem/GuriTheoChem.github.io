## Academic Experience

### PhD Thesis

*Ab Initio Insights into Molecular Magnetism: A Multireference Study of Transition Metal Complexes*  
Humboldt Universität zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany  
Supervisor: Michael Roemelt  

In this PhD thesis, the electronic structure and magnetic properties of several transition metal complexes were explored using many multireference methods, over three sub-projects:

- In the first project, magnetic exchange coupling of two copper dimers with methods such as DMRGSCF + NEVPT2, DDCI, and BS-LPNO-CCSD was studied.
- In the second project, the electronic structure of an ambiguous cobalt-oxo intermediate was investigated through a collaborative theoretical and experimental study.
- In the third project, a new methodology was developed to calculate spin-orbit coupling and g-tensors by combining QD-NEVPT2 with selected CI references, and was tested on benchmark systems.
